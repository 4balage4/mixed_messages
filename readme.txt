# Mixed Messages - Javascript

small app, it was an excercise on codecademy front-end course. 


Just click on the button 'generate' and will give you a message.

It mixes the questions/messages about who should be the enemy for the people of Hungary and which politican said it. Since the context is always the same (people must dislike, hate something) it just randomizes the current enemy and the politican. Showing how ridiculous is what the government feeds the people with.
